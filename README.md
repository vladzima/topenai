Developing Setup
----------------

If you want to set this package up for directly editing it's source code (for contributing):

1. ***Clone the package***

        git clone https://github.com/vladzima/topenai

2. ***Create a dynamic link***
    This will make the package dynamically update with your local changes:

        pip install -e .

#### TODO
- Make chat history more accesible
- Allow OpenAI API fune-tuning parameters
- Migrate to official OpenAI python API client
